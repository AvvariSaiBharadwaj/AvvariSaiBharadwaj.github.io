                    <p>I am still exploring many fields of Computer Science, but my current interests are Cloud Computing and Machine Learning. 
                        Most of my undergraduate work (course and personal projects) have been in the area of systems. My work at Salesforce 
                        currently involves creating and maintaining CI/CD pipelines for Salesforce Developers, as well as maintaining security 
                        aspects of Salesforce internal cloud hosted in AWS.</p>

                        CRAFT removes the language barrier to create Kubernetes Operators. CRAFT declares Kubernetes Operators in a robust 
                        and generic way for any resource, letting developers focus on CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations of 
                        resource management in a Dockerfile. You can find the github repo for CRAFT <a href="github.com/salesforce/craft">here</a>.

                        For a network cable under the sea, monitoring of power-level data is a trivial but important task to notice and report 
                        anomalies in power-level data. We built a Random – Forests based model to detect anomalies and raise alarms. Our bit-rate 
                        classifier worked at 96% accuracy.

                        With 5G networks looming up in the horizon, it becomes very important to be able to service trivial requests at the edge 
                        clouds and only direct important requests to public cloud, to reduce the latency and burden on public cloud. In this aspect, 
                        we worked on the framework of a controller model which enables dynamic redirection of requests between clusters. This helps 
                        the edge cloud to make a decision regarding rerouting the requests dynamically, based upon the complexity of the request.

                        As part of our understanding of the workings virtual memory, we wrote a just-in-time approach to allocating heap 
                        memory for the xv6 OS, implemented a demand paging policy accordingly and patched an exception handler.

                        (register renaming, loop unrolling) and MIPS assembly code generator.

                    <p>
                        As part of our understanding of the workings of processor pipelines and caches, we implemented a C++ code that would 
                        process a given set of instructions in the simulated 5 stage pipeline environment and give the output of the instrutions, 
                        the number of cycles taken and the changes to the cache simulator. The cache simulator would take input about the policy 
                        to be implemented, the size of sets and blocks and simulate the cache required for functioning.
