                    <p>I am a graduate with a Bachelor’s degree from IIT Madras in Computer Science, currently working as Associate Member of Technical Staff at Salesforce, Hyderabad. 
                        My journey started in a village called Aswapuram in Telangana, near the waters of the pious Godavari. I am interested in solving problems related to distributed 
                        systems latencies and security using public and private clouds and AI techniques. My Bachelor’s thesis was in the area of inter-cluster communication between public 
                        clouds under the guidance of Prof. D. Janakiram at IIT Madras. I have also worked on Kubernetes operators and ML anomaly detection systems. I am an extrovert who 
                        likes to savour the little pleasures that life offers. I am an avid story book reader, keyboard player, cricket player and enthusiast and a foodie.</p>
